# Inspire

Inspiration can be difficult to achieve. Keep track of your many important tasks and the weather with the subtle help of a random daily quote and beautiful scenery.

I created this Application in vanilla JavaScript this application was made as a replacement to your homescreen for your web browser. This application in linked to several Apis providing background images, current weather as well as insperational quotes.

- The Clock can be changed between 12/24 HR settings in the settings button on the upper left hand of the screen.
- The user can enter you name in the settings tab as well to display your name on the front
- The Greeting will change based on the time of a day it is. Morning, Afternoon and Night. 
- The user can add to-do's at the bottom left of the screen. 
- The user can change the background image by selecting the icon on the bottom left of the screen that looks like a picture.
- The user can change between C and F on the weather widget in the upper right hand of the screen.
- The weather icon will change depending on what the weather is outside
